# Snake-Water-Gun
In the game of "Snake, Water, Gun" players count to three in unison and simultaneously throw one of three hand signs representing Snake, Water, Gun The winner is determined by the rules: <ul>
<li>Snake beats Water (Snake drinks the water)</li>
<li>Water beats Gun (The gun will drown in water)</li>
<li>Gun beats  Snake (Gun will kill the snake)</li>
</ul>
In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw. <br>
In this project, we play this game with a computer using a Python script that randomly selects between snake, water, and gun and the game will continue until someone reaches the point limit specified by the player.
